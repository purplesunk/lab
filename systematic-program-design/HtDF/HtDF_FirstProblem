; Problem: Design a function that pluralizes a given word.
; (Pluralize means to convert the word to its plural form.)
; For simplicity you may assume that just adding s is enough to pluralize a word.

;; String -> String
;; produce a string with an added s
(check-expect (pluralize "car") "cars")
(check-expect (pluralize "ballon") "ballons")

;(define (pluralize string) "strings") ;this is stub
